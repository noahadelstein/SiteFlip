<br />
        <h2>Miscellanea</h2><p id = "semester">Normally independent study classes such as Ling 500 or Ling 499 are taken for 3 units, like the majority of other classes. If your senior capstone consists entirely of Ling 500, it should be 3 units. You are expected to put in about 125 hours of work for a 3-unit class. Independent study should result in substantial, assessable output, typically a research paper or a poster that you present at a conference or research fair. If you sign up for 3 units but do less work, your grade will be lowered substantially. If you will be doing a smaller project, consider signing up for 2 or even 1 unit. Only in very exceptional circumstances should an independent study be more than 3 units an hour. The absolute upper limit is that you may not take more than 6 units of independent study in any one semester, nor more than 18 units in toto across your undergraduate career; these limits include all your independent studies, not just Linguistics.</p>

<h2>Interaction With Majors and Other Minors</h2><p>If you wish to fulfill a Linguistics minor, you will in addition have a major and perhaps another minor. If the requirements for these other areas overlap with your Linguistics minor, the question arises as to whether they can double-count.</p><p>Your Linguistics Minor must include 12 units of classes that are not counted toward any other major or minor. Thus it is important that your Linguistics advisor knows what classes you intend to apply to them, so that this requirement is not violated. Note, however, that these rules mean that Linguistics will let you count one 3-unit class toward both Linguistics and a major or another minor. But be advised that just because Linguistics would let you double-count a course toward a Psychohistory major does not mean that the Psychohistory department has to let you do that.</p>
