        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          In ordinary discourse, a linguist is a person who has mastered many languages, and linguists quickly get used to being asked how many languages they can speak. But in academia, linguists study languages not because they wish to speak them fluently, but because they wish to understand the nature of Language in general.

          At Washington University, Linguistics is a special interdepartmental program that primarily serves undergraduates. Students may major or minor in Linguistics, and many of our courses can be used to fulfil cluster requirements. The Courses page includes courses taught by other departments which increase understanding of linguistics and can, in most cases, also be applied toward a Linguistics major or minor.      </p>

  <h2 id ="jumboheader">Undergraduate Research</h2>
  <p id = "jumbotext">

    There are many opportunities for undergraduate research in linguistics at Washington University. The best way to find opportunities is to approach one of the core faculty members of the Linguistics Program or one of the participating faculty members. They may be able to include you in a research project already in progress or help you to develop a new research project.

    The Gilbert W. Meier and Colene McKinney Undergraduate Internship is an excellent opportunity for undergraduates to undertake training in linguistic research methods.

<br />
  <h2 id ="jumboheader">Gilbert W. Meier and Colene McKinney Undergraduate Internship</h2>


The Gilbert W. Meier and Colene McKinney Undergraduate Internship was established to promote undergraduate training in linguistic research methods. There are a number of ways in which students might use the funds provided through the internship to undertake training in linguistic research. For example, they might attend a summer institute or training program, or they might pursue a research project supervised by a faculty member.
<br /><br />

Applications should be submitted to the director of the linguistics program by the final day of classes fall semester. One application will be selected for funding each year.

<br />
<br />

Applications should consist of a 1-2 page proposal outlining the project or program to be undertaken. The application should indicate how the funds awarded are to be spent, and it should explain the importance of the project or program to the student's training in linguistic research methods. The application might be for an internship during the following calendar year or during the summer and following academic year, depending on the needs of the program or project.
<br />
<br />
Interns are required to submit a report on their training experience  (8-10 pages) by the last day of classes in the final semester of their internship. Students whose internship includes a research project will also be required to present their research at the Washington University Undergraduate Research Symposium in the semester following their internship.
<br />
<br />
For additional information or questions about the internship, please contact Brett Hyde.

The gift establishing the Gilbert W. Meier and Colene McKinney Undergraduate Internship was made in honor of Dr. Gilbert W. Meier (BA48, GR53) and Colene Van Deusen, n√©e McKinney (BA48), the parents of Dr. Richard P. Meier (GR75). Dr. Richard P. Meier is currently the chair of the Linguistics Department at the University of Texas at Austin. The gift was made by Dr. Gilbert W. Meier, Dr. Richard P. Meier, Dr. Madeline C. Sutherland-Meier, and Colene Van Deusen.
